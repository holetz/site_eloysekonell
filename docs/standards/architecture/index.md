# `standards/architecture/`

System structure (layers, modules, boundaries) and the current/active **architectural
patterns**. **`patterns` lives here** — there is no `docs/patterns/`; a design pattern is
a doc in this home.

**Boundary:** the shape of the system (the structural *why*). Code conventions (imports,
lint, symbols) live in [../code/](../code/index.md). An agreed-but-unproven architectural
rule sits here as `authority: background` (no separate decisions home). One standard per file
(files, not sub-folders); each carries `type: standard` + a derived `resource:`; add each to
[../index.md](../index.md).

## Candidate sub-standards

Break this subject **one concept per file**. The method evaluates each candidate against
the repo, generates the applicable ones (`file:line`-anchored, full OKF frontmatter), and
records the rest below as deferrals (never a silent skip):
`layers` · `module-boundaries` · `patterns` · `dependency-direction` · `integration-points`.

## Coverage / deferred sub-standards

Per-subject ledger the verify gate reads. A subject is "done" only when every candidate is
**present or listed here** with a one-line why.
