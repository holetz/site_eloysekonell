# `standards/workflows/`

The job/task/schema framework — how work is defined, its parameters, scheduling, and
orchestration.

**Boundary:** the *framework that runs the work*; the *build/deploy* of that code lives in
[../ci-cd/](../ci-cd/index.md). One standard per file (files, not sub-folders); each
carries `type: standard` + a derived `resource:`; add each to [../index.md](../index.md).

## Candidate sub-standards

Break this subject **one concept per file**. The method evaluates each candidate against
the repo, generates the applicable ones (`file:line`-anchored, full OKF frontmatter), and
records the rest below as deferrals (never a silent skip):
`job-framework` · `task-parameters` · `scheduling` · `orchestration`.

## Coverage / deferred sub-standards

Per-subject ledger the verify gate reads. A subject is "done" only when every candidate is
**present or listed here** with a one-line why.
